The Mombasa Student Leaders Association, representing universities, colleges, and TVETs, led by **Ogema Titus**, known as "Governor" from the University of Nairobi (Mombasa Campus), is rallying students across the region. On the **9th of September 2024**, students are called to join the **"Tisa Tisa" demonstration**, a peaceful protest against the newly introduced student funding model by the government.

Ogema Titus voiced concerns over the discriminatory nature of the funding model, calling it "*sio sawa kabisa*" for the government to introduce such a system.

> "The government has not been clear on how they intend to identify students for funding in the various banks they've mentioned. *Hii ni kudharau wanafunzi!* We believe that education is a fundamental right that the government should fully support, not divide," he argued.

The new funding model, which prioritizes students' financial need and separates placement from funding, has left students in turmoil. Instead of universities and TVETs receiving block funding through capitation, the model now provides scholarships, loans, and household contributions directly to students.

Ogema Titus and his fellow student leaders like **Abdihamid Suleiman** of MKU (Mombasa Campus), **Mohammed Jeilani** of UON (Mombasa Campus), and **Fwedi Dennis** of MKU (Mombasa Campus) argue that this system complicates access and only increases the financial burden on students and their families.

> "We are asking the government to consolidate these funds into a single basket so that the entire process becomes simpler and cheaper. *Hii funding model sio fair*, and we reject it!" Titus added.

The students demand the government halt the implementation of the new model and revert to the previous system while seeking alternative solutions to make education more affordable for everyone.

As the September 9th protest approaches, students and parents from all corners of Mombasa's institutions are gearing up for the **Tisa Tisa demonstration**, determined to make their voices heard. They believe that with unity and loud cries for justice, they can push for a change in how the government supports their education.

*"Mabadiliko lazima!"*
